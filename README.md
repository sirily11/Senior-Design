## Original Project Abstract

> Assurance (or safety) cases are logical argument structures used for safety and certification of safety critical systems such as airplanes, nuclear power plants, etc. These normally are represented using the goal structuring notation (GSN). Recently we have begun to apply safety cases to emerging domains such as synthetic biology. However, end-users in these domains lack the expertise to build up an effective GSN argument. Further, they often only create small/parts of a program and they use similar (repeated) approaches in their program designs. Therefore, we have proposed the idea of a design recipe. These take their inspiration from software design patterns, but have concrete parameters that the user can instantiate. The user has a pre-defined structure as a starting point and all they need to do is to select (and edit) their specific data. In prior work we built a prototype web application to allow users to build assurance recipes. This was used by students in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. This project will start from the initial prototype, re-design it for a host system at ISU and develop a more full-featured online application. Users will have a graphical interface that will allow them to both design and view/print their recipe. A backend will store intermediate designs that users can retrieve if they create an account. The team will learn about assurance cases, design patterns, synthetic biology and current web-based technologies. Development on the original system used node.js and the mongo db.
