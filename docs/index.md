# Help Docs of Running the project

## Getting start

To install the project on your machine, you have three options.
- Install natively using Yarn
- Install using docker (This docker doesn't contain the automatically run, in fact it contains a code server which you can write code directly in your browser)
- Using VM (This actually is running docker inside the VM for windows user. If you are using unix system like MacOS, you can ignore this)
